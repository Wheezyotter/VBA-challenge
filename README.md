# VBA-challenge

This VBA script calculates the Yearly Change, Percent Change, Total Stock Volume, Greatest Percent Increase, Greatest Percent Decrease, and Greatest Total Stock Volume based on yearly stock data. Years are seperated by excel sheets within the work book and the script runs once for all sheets. Summary tables are produced on each sheet with the results.

This script was made for UCB Data Analytics Challenge 2.
